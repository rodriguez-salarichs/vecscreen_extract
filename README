Program extracts a valuable information from an output vecscreen file


Usage: statistic_vecscreen.x -ivf2 file.txt -bin i

-vf2 Output file obtained from the vecscreen execution when the option -f in the vecscreen
     program was defined as 2

-bin Intervals of histogram (defaults=0.5)


The sequence regions are cataloged in weak, moderate,strong and suspect origin according
to their likelihood to be a vector


Strong Match to Vector: Strong matches usually indicate that the segment originated from 
foreign DNA (vector, adapter, linker, or primer) that was attached to the source DNA/RNA 
during the cloning process.(Expect 1 random match in 1,000,000 queries of length 350 kb.)


Moderate Match to Vector: Strong matches usually indicate that the segment originated from 
foreign DNA (vector, adapter, linker, or primer) that was attached to the source DNA/RNA 
during the cloning process.(Expect 1 random match in 1,000 queries of length 350 kb.)


Weak Match to Vector: Although weak matches often occur by chance, they indicate foreign 
sequence whenever there is corroborating evidence of contamination.(Expect 1 random match 
in 40 queries of length 350 kb.)
